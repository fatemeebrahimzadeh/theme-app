#theme-app

This repository contains a Sass mixin for selecting color variables based on the main theme of the app. The mixin takes in a theme object and returns the appropriate color variable based on the main theme. This allows for easy theming of a website or application, as the appropriate color variables can be assigned to elements using the generated variables.

To use the mixin, simply import the mixin file into your Sass code and call the mixin with the theme object and the color variable name as arguments. The mixin will return the appropriate color variable based on the main theme and the provided color variable name, which can then be used in your Sass code.

This mixin is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to easily create and use different themes for your projects. It is also compatible with most Sass frameworks and libraries, including Bootstrap and Foundation.

The repository includes example code demonstrating how to use the mixin with different themes and color variables. Feel free to use and modify the code to fit your specific needs. Whether you are building a small website or a large application, this repository provides a simple and efficient way to select color variables based on the main theme of your app.
