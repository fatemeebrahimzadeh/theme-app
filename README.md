#theme-app

This repository contains a mixin for generating color variables based on a theme. The mixin takes in a theme object and generates CSS variables for each color in the theme. This allows for easy theming of a website or application, as the color variables can be assigned to elements using the generated CSS variables.

To use the mixin, simply import the mixin file and call the mixin with the theme object as an argument. The mixin will generate CSS variables for each color in the theme, which can then be used in your CSS code.

This mixin is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to easily create and use different color themes for your projects. It is compatible with most CSS preprocessors, including Sass and Less.

The repository also includes example code demonstrating how to use the mixin with different themes. Feel free to use and modify the code to fit your specific needs.
